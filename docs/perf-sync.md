# OK So, React?

We've decided our glorious future will be React-based ðŸŽ‰

# Sooo, time toâ€¦

---

# Componentize Everything!

Converting jQuery + Handlebars views to React will be a challenge

But it might not even be the Hard Partâ„¢

---

> We can no longer have all users and channels in memory.
-- Abraham Lincoln

# Wait, What?

The hard part is converting components from a data model that assumes we have everything, to one where you might not.

```js
// Easy!
TS.model.channels[0].name
>>> devel-react

// We'll never be able to debug this as this gets bigger
TS.models.getChannel(0).then(x => dieInside());
```

The old model is *straightforward*. New developers can program against it fairly easily. We need a model that retains that ease for Most People.

---

# The long and short of it

### If we hoist the complexity of asynchrony and fetching data up to every view individually, we will be in _the world's biggest can of worms, forever_.

---

# Redux is Great...

Redux is great â€“ we've used it in the Desktop app and it provides some ðŸ†’ benefits:

* Your whole app state in one tree: *Introspectible!*
* Actions for everything: *Debuggable!*
* Reducers for everything: *Functionally elegant!*

---

# But it is Insufficient ðŸ˜”

* Redux doesn't solve the core issue: partial models.

* Having your app state in one object might cause us to run _towards_ this problem rather than away from it.

### Demo

# Our Goals

- The amount of memory we use is proportional to the number of things on screen.
  - Nothing on screen? No(\*) memory usage.

- Writing views should be super easy, and reading the implementation of views should be a joy.
  - Polluting every view with fetching and retries and caching will make every view a disaster.

---

# Our Goals

- The way that data gets _into_ Slack should be completely unrelated to the way that devs _access_ data.
  - Views don't really care where data comes from, they just say what they want.

- Electron apps don't have to use 2GB of memory, and can be *really fast*. Prove it.

---

# Wait, are you building a Slack client tho???

---

# :no_good:

---

# Wait, are you building a Slack client tho???

* Our goal is to build _pieces_ that we can end up using anywhere.

* While these pieces go really well _together_, you're not opting-in to a Capital-F _Framework_. Each piece works standalone!

* The UI you saw is basically the world's most involved integration test â€“ it's a way to exercise the developer experience.

# Updatable: A Lazy Promise

- Updatables are like a Promise that doesn't necessarily do its work immediately

- You can always get the current value of an Updatable, though it may be null

```js
// Okay
console.log(generalChannel.value.name);
>>> announcements-general
```

```js
// Better
generalChannel.get().then(value => console.log(value.name));
>>> announcements-general
```
---

# Updatable: A Lazy Promise

- Updatables can change _more than once_ (as opposed to a Promise, that only `then`s once).

- Updatables let you listen for when an object changes:

```js
let currentName = generalChannel.value.name;
generalChannel.subscribe(channel => {
  if (currentName === channel.name) return;

  currentName = channel.name;
  console.log(`The new general channel name is ${currentName}!`);
});
```

---

# Updatables know how to get the latest version of themselves

```js
// Fetch the very latest channel name
generalChannel.invalidate();
generalChannel.get().then(value => console.log(value.name));
```

---

# Updatables know how to get the latest version of themselves

* Invalidate can also be used to handle models that are incomplete:

```js
// If we don't know enough about a channel (because, say, we got it from
// `users.counts`), fill it up with another API call
channel = generalChannel.value;

if (!channel.topic) {
  generalChannel.invalidate();
  channel = await generalChannel.get();
}

console.log(channel.topic);
```

---

# SparseMap - like an on-demand Map

- Knows how to create Updatables for a certain "class" of thing (users, channels)

```js
// Always returns an Updatable of _something_
const myChannel = channelList.listen('C032AB90');

myChannel.get().then(channel => console.log(channel.name));
>>> "random"
```

---

# SparseMap - like an on-demand Map

- If we've seen that data recently, :tada: - if not, you might make a network request, or receive stale data.

- In the future, Updatables will be able to tell you when they've last updated, or you can request that certain fields be present.

---

# A ViewModel is a Model Of A View

- Testing React components using tree diffs requires constant maintenance
- Testing against Plain Ol' Objects is easier
- Our ViewModels have the unique property that, you can listen to changes on them

```js
myChannel.changed
  .subscribe(x => console.log(`${x.property} is now ${x.value}`));
```

---

# Let's make that a bit easier

```js
when(myChannel, x => x.unreadCount)
  .subscribe(x => console.log(`Unread count is now ${x}`));

myChannel.unreadCount = 5;
>>> Unread count is now 5
```

---

# Models and Updatables 2Gether In Love

- ViewModels make it easy to turn Updatables into Properties.

- Conveniently, this means we don't really have to think about Subscribing.

---

# Models and Updatables 2Gether In Love

```js
export class UserViewModel extends Model {
  @fromObservable model: User;
  @fromObservable displayName: string;
  @fromObservable profileImage: string;

  // This User is just an object from `users.info` or an RTM event
  constructor(Updatable<User> model, id: string, api: Api) {
    super();

    // Always keep a current copy of the User
    model.toProperty(this, 'model');

    // The DisplayName updates whenever the Model changes
    when(this, x => x.model)
      .map(user => user ? user.real_name || user.name : '')
      .toProperty(this, 'displayName');

    // The ProfileImage updates whenever the Model changes, and if it's
    // initially empty, give them a default
    when(this, x => x.model)
      .map(user => {
        if (!user) return defaultAvatar;
        return user.profile.image_48;
      })
      .toProperty(this, 'profileImage');
  }
}
```

# Is this _Not Invented Here_ syndrome??? ðŸ¤”

* Most of these concepts aren't new; much of it feels like ![](https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/17475736?v=3&s=200) **MobX**

* MobX is a popular Redux alternative based on **`Observable`s**

* We could ~~pilfer~~ reuse MobX implementations if we prefer their API

# Part Two Coming Soon

# THE OUTLINE

#### Why even?

- We can't have everything in memory any more. Full stop.
- The average developer shouldn't have to think about RTM.start vs users.counts to build features
  - When views all know about fetching data, it makes changing the data sources Difficult
- How would we design the Slack data model in 2017, given that Teams aren't going to mean anything, and shared / enterprise identities are The Default?
- How hard does Offline From Day One make things?

#### Red Threads

- The amount of memory we use is proportional to the number of things on screen
- Writing views should be super easy, and reading the implementation of views should be a joy
- The way that data gets _into_ Slack should be completely unrelated to the way that devs access data
- Electron apps don't have to use 2GB of memory. Prove it.

#### Demo Ideas

- Boot the app, show memory usage
- Prove we're connected to WS
- Show scrolling speed (open FPS counter)
- Close drawer, show memory go down

#### Concepts to Introduce (in order, i.e. drop stuff from the end)

- Updatable
  - "A Lazy Promise"
  - Knows what it is Right Now, and how to get the Latest Version
  - Future: Being able to get staleness, request missing fields (users.counts vs user.info)

- SparseMap
  - Knows how to create Updatables for a certain "class" of thing (users, channels)
  - Conceptually like a Dictionary - you'll always get A Thing, but what you get might be either stale, or pending

- "Model" aka ViewModels
  - Easy to test! Just create them
  - Properties that tell us when they change

- Models and Updatables 2Gether In Love
  - Mention `when` and `toProperty`
  - UserViewModel a good demo class

- The Store
  - Store isn't like a Redux Store
  - It's our equivalent of TS.model.*
  - But more importantly, it's where all of the ugly code lives that handles _writing_ data
  - The store's _interface_ stays the same'ish, but its implementation can change

- React Integration
  - Views know about their containing ViewModels (no props, no state)
  - If a ViewModel updates, the View renders Automagically
  - Views destroy their ViewModels on componentDidUnmount, and ViewModels destroy their connection to the Updatable
